Pet Facts is an app that will let you create, store, and edit key information about each of your pets so you have it all safe in one place.

## Installation

To run this app, open your terminal and run

git clone git@github.com:mariel-delagarza/pet-facts.git
```

Then change into the directory "pet-facts" and run "bundle install".

## Usage

Once the gem installation is complete, enter "shotgun" in your terminal and copy/paste the IP address that appears into your browser. This should take you to the welcome page. From there, it can be operated as a functioning website.
